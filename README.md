# 🕵️‍♂️ NetDetective v1.0

NetDetective is a simple, interactive, and colorful network investigation and analysis tool built in Python.  
It allows you to perform **Ping Sweeps** across a subnet and **Port Scanning** on a specific IP address using Nmap.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Ping Sweep** to identify live hosts on a subnet using ARP/ICMP
- 🔍 **Port Scanner** to scan a specific IP address and port range
- 🧠 Intelligent input validation for IP addresses, port ranges, and CIDR
- 📈 Latency tracking, MAC address resolution, and vendor identification
- 🧱 Menu-driven CLI interface for ease of use

## ✅ Compatibility

| Platform       | Supported | Notes                                                 |

| macOS          | ✅ Yes     | Works smoothly with Homebrew-installed Nmap.          |
| Windows (CMD)  | ✅ Yes     | Needs Nmap installed & run via Python or WSL.         |
| Windows (WSL)  | ✅ Yes     | Fully compatible under WSL with Nmap installed.       |
| Python Version | 3.6+        | Python 3.9+ recommended for timezone handling.        |

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [`python-nmap`](https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/)
- [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/) installed on your system

### Install Dependencies:

```cmd
    pip install python-nmap
```


Make sure Nmap is installed and accessible via CLI:

    You need to ensure that the directory containing the program is added to your system's PATH environmental variable 

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

```cmd
python3 NetDetective-v1.0.py
```

You'll be presented with a menu:

```text
        Please select an option:
          1. Host Discovery With Ping Sweep (CIDR subnet scan)
          2. Port Scanner (Single IP with port range)
          3. Exit
```

### 🔹 Ping Sweep Example

```text
        Enter subnet (CIDR, e.g. 192.168.1.0/24): 192.168.1.0/24
```

It will display live hosts, latency, MAC address, and vendor.

### 🔸 Port Scanner Example

```text
        Please enter the IP address that you want to scan: 192.168.1.10
        Enter port range: 20-100
```

It will show which ports are open/closed and service/version info.
